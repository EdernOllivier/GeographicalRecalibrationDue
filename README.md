# GeographicalRecalibrationDue
There is a geographical recalibration to be executed by GPS and IMU with a simple Kalman filter on an UNO/Due Arduino board.

The GPS doesn't work properly at porting from the Arduino UNO to the Arduino Due.

Maybe that the patch to apply to hybride it has not succeeded.
